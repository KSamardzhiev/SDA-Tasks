First of all, sign up for github. Use this:
https://github.com/

Then download git for your computer and install it.
Any questions you have regarding git can be answered by Google.
Heres a small guide however.

Once you're done with installing git, create a new Repository in your github.
You can call it whatever you want (keep in mind that this is going to be
the name of the folder where your project files are going to be stored)
Be sure to select the "Create README.MD" checkbox!

Then on your computer, open the folder where you store your projects.
Right click and choose Git Bash from the dialog (its gonna be in the middle).

In git bash type:
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR USERNAME>/<YOUR REPOSITORY>

In my case for this repository, I used:
git clone https://github.com/jorenca/SDA-Tasks


After you're done with this, you can start creating and editing files in the
folder that was created by git clone (my folder was named SDA-Tasks).

When you want to upload (commit) your changes to github, do this in the git bash:
git add -A (this adds all files to the commit)
git commit -m "your message about this commit"
git push

Then git will ask you for your username and password on github.
Type them in and you should be all set!
